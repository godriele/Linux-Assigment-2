# Linux System Assignment 2: Shell Scripting

Welcome! This project is all about setting up a Linux environment using a few simple scripts. It’s meant to help you quickly configure a new Linux system by automating things like setting up configuration files, installing packages, and linking important files.

# Introduction

This **Linux System Assignment 2** project has two parts:

# Project 1
1. **Configuration Setup Script**: This clones a Git repository with config files and links them where they need to go on your system.
2. **Packages Script**: This installs some useful packages.
3. **System Setup Script**: This script can run the first two scripts for you with a simple command.

## Prerequisites

To use these scripts, you’ll need:

- **Git**: for cloning repositories.
- **Bash Shell**: for running the script (most Linux systems have Bash by default).
- **Pacman**: the package manager for Arch Linux (required for Project 2).
